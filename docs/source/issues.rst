#. Navigate to the 'Issues' Tab
#. Check to see if the issue has already been reported. If not then press the 'New Issue' button
#. Give the issue a brief, sensible and descriptive title. For example "Error loading h5oina" file
#. In the description, give a more detailed descrition of the issue. Some useful notes to include would be:

   * The error message

   * The cell you ran which produced the error message

   * Information about the files / workflow are using which might make it different from the example workbooks

   * Any other information that might help with reproducing the error

#. Under the labels on the right hand side, select the 'bug' label
#. Under the type section, select 'bug'

After the issue is reported, someone will look into it. They may leave a comment on the issue asking for more information, or may be able to fix it and close it

Once an issue is fixed, you may need to redownload and reinstall sigma to get the latest version with the bug fix.
