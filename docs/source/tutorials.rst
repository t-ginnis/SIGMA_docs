Interactive SEM Tutorial
------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial is designed to walk-through the key features of SIGMA2, and demonstrates the workflow that can be used to analyse EDS data with the tools provided.

In general, the philosopy behind the SIGMA workflow is:

#. Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset into a **latent space**.
#. Produce **clusters** by grouping points in the latent space together.
#. Perform Non-negative Matrix Factorisation **(NMF)** on these clusters to determine the constituent phases that make up the sample

Opening the Notebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start jupyter lab by running the following in the ``sigma2`` environment in the ``conda`` terminal in the ``SIGMA2`` folder.

.. code-block:: bash

   jupyter lab


A browser window should open, with jupyter lab running. Navigate to the ``Interactive_SEM_tutorial.ipynb`` notebook in the tutorials folder, and open it. 

Importing the Required Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first code cell of the notebook should look like:

.. code-block:: python 

   from umap import UMAP # for UMAP latent space projections
   import sys # for relative imports of sigma
   sys.path.insert(0,"..")
   from sigma.utils import normalisation as norm 
   from sigma.utils import visualisation as visual
   from sigma.utils.load import SEMDataset
   from sigma.src.utils import same_seeds
   from sigma.src.dim_reduction import Experiment
   from sigma.models.autoencoder import AutoEncoder
   from sigma.src.segmentation import PixelSegmenter
   from sigma.gui import gui



Running this cell will:

* Import the ``umap`` package which is needed to perform latent space projections
* Import the `sys` package -this is needed to perform "relative imports" of SIGMA2


.. note::
   SIGMA2 is still in development, so for the time being it is imported using relative imports. When you create your own notebooks for analysis, you will need to ensure the relative imports "point" to the correct place - see :doc:`personal` section for more information about using SIGMA for your own data analysis.
