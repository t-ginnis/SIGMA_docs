Interactive SEM Tutorial
------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial is designed to walk-through the key features of SIGMA2, and demonstrates the workflow that can be used to analyse EDS data with the tools provided.

In general, the philosopy behind the SIGMA workflow is:

#. Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset into a **latent space**.
#. Produce **clusters** by grouping points in the latent space together.
#. Perform Non-negative Matrix Factorisation **(NMF)** on these clusters to determine the constituent phases that make up the sample

Opening the Notebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start jupyter lab by running the following in the ``sigma2`` environment in the ``conda`` terminal in the ``SIGMA2`` folder.

.. code-block:: bash

   jupyter lab


A browser window should open, with jupyter lab running. Navigate to the ``Interactive_SEM_tutorial.ipynb`` notebook in the tutorials folder, and open it.
